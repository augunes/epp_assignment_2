Discussion: Using Metadata Programmatically vs. Hardcoding Variable Names

* Using metadata programmatically makes the code more flexible. If variable names change in future datasets, the cleaning function still works without updates.

* Metadata reduces mistakes. Instead of typing names manually in several places, you read everything from one metadata file, lowering the risk of typos or mismatches.

* Hardcoding names is simpler, but fragile. It may work for one dataset, but breaks easily if anything in the raw data changes.

* Using metadata is better for long-term use. It makes the code easier to maintain and reuse.
